# Dense matrices and low rank approximation

Several examples show how to combine low rank approximation techniques with the provided integral methods:

1. [HSS/HODLR applied to PEEC with 1D elements](../src/peec1D/lowrank)
2. [HSS/HODLR applied to PEEC with 2D quadrilateral elements (Axisymmetric - Coulombian formulation)](../src/AxialCoulombian)
3. [HSS/HODLR applied to Volume Integral with tetrahedral elements](../src/VolumeIntegral_tetra)
