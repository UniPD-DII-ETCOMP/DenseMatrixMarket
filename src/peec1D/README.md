#PEEC 1D by Riccardo Torchio (riccardo.torchio@studenti.unipd.it)

This directory contains a PEEC code, based on stick elements, for the solution of full-wave electromagnetic problems.

In this code, the PEEC system of equations is assembled in its reduced form where currents 
only are considered as unknowns:

[R+1j*w*L+(1/(1j*w*)A^T*P*A)j=e 

see [1] for more details and consider citing it.

In this code only conductive media modeled by thin 1D (a.k.a "stick") elements are 
considered.

% Description
 
MAIN_PEEC_sticks_MF.m is the main file you must run to start the code. 
                      The final system of equations is generated by a function                      
                      handle "sys_MF" which allows computing either the full PEEC system 
                      or a generic block of it (or a single entry). 
                      Thus, this code is suitable for the application of 
                      low-rank compression techniques, e.g: 
                      https://github.com/numpi/hm-toolbox
                      https://github.com/klho/FLAM/
                      The varibale "barDoFs" contains the barycenters
                      related to the Degrees of Freedom, i.e. stick currents (and other lumped circuit currents)

All user-settable quantities, e.g. frequency and resistivity, are contained in the block identified by the 
BEGIN USER SETTINGS / END USER SETTINGS comments.

Available test cases
--------------------
6 test cases are contained in separate directories under "test_cases". Each directory contains a description.txt file.
Set the "test_case_dir" variable in "MAIN_PEEC_sticks_MF.m" to the appriapriate directory.

User-defined test cases
-----------------------
Follow the instuctions given in "README.txt" inside the "test_cases" directory.
