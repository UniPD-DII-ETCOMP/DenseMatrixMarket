% Y = LYAP_GALERKIN(HA, HB, C, bsa, bsb) solves the (projected) Lyapunov
%        equation HA1 * Y + Y * HB1' = C1, where HA1 is obtained shrinking
%        HA by BSA columns and rows, HB1 is obtained shrinking HB1 by BSB
%        columns and rows, and C1 is obtained cutting C accordingly.

% [Y, RES] = LYAP_GALERKIN(HA, HB, C, bsa, bsb) does the same computation
%        but also computes the residual of the unprojected equation,
%        assuming that HA, HB, and C have been projected using a
%        Krylov-type method and that the action of A on the basis excluding
%        the last BSA (resp. BSB) columns is contained in the full basis.
